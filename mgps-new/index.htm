                                It is my personal experience that reading habit is the soul of learning.
                                Books are silent teachers that provide butter of information skimmed from
                                 rich experience &amp; yawning thoughts. New generation is equipped with more
                                  comfortable learning tools viz. different forms of audio visual systems,
                                  internet &amp; television being the most popular among them, where least
                                    efforts are required to assimilate readymade knowledge. In our school students are encouraged for self-learning 
                                                    through child centric methodologies and are encouraged to cooperate and coordinate with their peers to
